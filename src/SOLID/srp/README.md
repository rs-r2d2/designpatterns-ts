### (S)ingle Responsibility Principle


* A class should have one reason to change.
* Separation of concern - different classes 
handling different
independent tasks/problems.

In example,

> Journal class handles all responsibility 
> related to maintaining the journal only.

> Persistent class handles all responsibility 
> related to saving of journal.
