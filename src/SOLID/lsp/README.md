### Liskov Substitution Principle

* Sub class can be substituted for a base class.

In example,

> Square class is violating by implementing 
> addHeight and addWidth methods.
> Square class cannot be used for Rectangle.
> Which is a subclass of Rectangle

> It can be resolved by implementing isSquare method 
> in Rectangle.
